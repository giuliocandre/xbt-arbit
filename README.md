README.md

Two folders are present:
- php
- py

These two contain the same project written in two different languages (respectively php and python).
Once you enter the language directory you'll find different folders, one per website (kraken, coinbase, itbit, ...) 
inside each folder there is a wrapper for the HTTP REST API of that website.

TODO
- modify the api wrappers and set a standard for the constructors and all the methods
- create a client that manages an arbitrary number of APIs
- develop the algorithm
